## Requirements
  1. Install Lithops from the PyPi repository:

      ```bash
      $ pip install lithops
      ```
   2. Configuration:
   
   Lithops provides an extensible backend architecture (compute, storage) that is designed to work with different Cloud providers and on-premise backends. In this sense, you can      code in python and run it unmodified in IBM Cloud, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba Aliyun. Moreover, it provides support for running jobs on vanilla kubernetes, or by        using a kubernetes serverless framework like Knative or OpenWhisk.
